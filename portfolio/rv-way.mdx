			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p>
				RV Way is a route planning web app designed specifically for people who
				travel in RV’s. Allowing users to input their vehicle’s specifications,
				<strong>
					RV Way generates a route that guides them safely to their destination.
				</strong>
				My team made the app more intuitive by designing a clean and simple look
				that appealed to our older demographic. We used conversational language
				and avoided jargon since our users might not be tech-savvy.

			Recreational vehicles (RVs for short), represent adventure, the open road,
			and independence.
		</strong>
		<span>
			The use of social media, the Tiny House Movement, and #VanLife have
			brought mobile-living into the public eye. And as the cost of living
			climbs higher and higher,
		</span>
		<strong>
			the ability to take your home with you is becoming increasingly more
			attractive.
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		At the beginning of the project, I knew next to nothing about the RV world.
		My knowledge was limited to passing them on the highway and what I’d seen in
		movies (raise your hand if you remember RV with Robin Williams).
		<strong>
			I never would have guessed the depth of which the RV community cares for
			each other, or how thoughtful they are of the world around them.
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		During my interviews with RVers (both full-time and part-time)
		<strong>
			the most consistent descriptor I heard was “tribe.” RVers rely on each
			other for important information
		</strong>
		(one woman we interviewed will actually get in her car and drive around a
		new area with a tape measure to make sure bridges are actually the height
		the sign claims).
		<strong>
			They are a family, a community, a tribe. They care for one another,
			whether they’ve met in person or not.

</div>
<p>My team was tasked with improving the usability of the product, then named RV Nav. We began this process by reviewing the previous team’s documentation, getting to know the users, and conducting usability testing to see what worked, and what didn’t.</p>
<p>
    <strong>It became clear early on that we would have to totally redesign the user interface (UI), as testing showed it was not clear what the app was for, or how to navigate it.</strong>
</p>
<p>Overhauling a product’s entire UI in 8 weeks or less is no small feat. Knowing that improvement is a never-ending process and to keep ourselves on track, we focused on the following goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide the most efficient and safe route for users who drive their RV's around</li>
    <li>Give users the most accurate intel based on their details and preferences</li>
    <li>Continuously improve the routing function through additional data sources and crowd-sourced data</li>
    <li>Provide users with a simple and beautiful app design to yield a better RV traveling experiences</li>
</ul>

<p>
	My partner and I wanted to engage our entire team in our process early on.{" "}
	<strong>
		This not only helped build camaraderie, but it also helped our developers
		and data scientists understand what we, as UX designers, were contributing
		to the team.
	</strong>{" "}
	They were so excited when we asked them to join us for a brainstorming
	workshop!
</p>

<p>
	During this workshop, we worked as a team to create initial survey questions,
	and asked <strong>how might we achieve our goals?</strong>
</p>

<img
	className="portfolio-image"
	src="/images/rv-way/hmw.png"
	alt="sorted cards from brainstorming"
/>

<p>
	<strong>
		We had the absolute pleasure of interviewing a wide range of people
		throughout this entire process.
	</strong>
	They shared stories of life on the road (both full-time and part-time), what it’s
	like to raise a family in 400sqft (or less), maneuverability successes, scariest
	moments, hilarious anecdotes, and so much more.

		Chatting with D & M was a blast. My face hurt from laughing so much!

</figure>
<p>
	While a wealth of invaluable information was shared with us during our
	interviews, one of my favorite anecdotes was the term Stick-and-Bricker:
	referring to someone who lives in a stationary home.
</p>
<p>
	The whole RV experience is extremely personal, and the majority of RVers rely
	on each other for important tips and safety information via message boards and
	Facebook groups.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		During our initial interviews, we learned that many of our users preferred
		products that had a personal touch. They didn’t want to feel like they were
		interacting with a robot, but with a fellow RVer{" "}
	</strong>{" "}
	(or at least a humanoid robot!). Taking the community mindset into account, we
	designed an onboarding experience to feel conversational and personalized.

    </div>
    <p>In the existing app, users input their vehicle’s specifications, then a route was generated that’s safe for RVs. But <strong>early testing showed that the user interface was not intuitive. </strong>It wasn’t clear what the user is supposed to do first when they arrived on the map page.<br/><strong>Navigating the app was confusing and overall, the existing solution was just not usable.</strong></p>

	The original design didn’t meet accessibility standards and the home page was not

		We experimented with many names related to RVs and life on the road, and

		Understanding the steps our users will take to reach their destination is
		just as important in UX as it is when planning a road trip.
	</strong>
	<p>
		Just like many road trips, our user flow took a rather circuitous route to
		reach its final form. And as RVers know perhaps better than anyone,
		<strong>
			once we understood our route, it was all about the journey from then on.

    </div>
    <p><strong>Working on this project drove home the mindset of “you are not your users,” </strong>because design, like road trips, doesn’t always go according to plan. Sometimes you have to choose an alternative route, and finding the best option is often an iterative process.</p>
    <p>Initially, we relied on assumptions loosely backed by research for all of our design decision. By conducting usability tests and getting feedback from peers <strong>we were able to make iterations based not only on what we thought would work but what our users actually needed.</strong></p>

<p>
	<strong>
		We found that our initial design for the home page was too vague and created
		a false bottom
	</strong>
	I think of this as “the curse of the Dribbble shot mindset”). Users didn’t know
	to scroll down for more information.
	<strong>
		We updated the background illustrations to be more visually interesting
		without causing a distraction and updated the copy to be descriptive.
	</strong>
</p>

<p>
	We received feedback that the sign-up background was too chaotic, so we
	adjusted the colors to make the sign-up form pop.
</p>

	className="portfolio-image"
	src="/images/rv-way/sign-up-iterations.png"
	alt="Iterations of the sign-up page"

<p>
	Feedback about the sign-up page was unanimous: while the mountain illustration
	was cool, it didn’t convey the same feeling as the two-dimensional mountains
	used everywhere else in the design. Taking this feedback into account, we
	changed the sign-in page to be visually similar to the rest of the app. To
	help distinguish it from the sign-up page, we went with a nighttime color
	scheme.

<Section title="Design System" icon="/images/rv-way/design-system-icon.png">
<p>We took an afternoon to gather inspiration, dive into colors, and explore typefaces.
       We asked ourselves, <strong>“What feeling are we trying to convey? What colors help convey those feelings?”</strong></p>

<h5>Color Palette</h5>
<p>
	Avoiding the urge to use every color under the sun, we kept things simple by
	choosing one primary color and one accent.
	<strong>
		They represent freedom, adventure, friendliness, reliability, safety, and
		joy.
	</strong>
	Using opacity helped keep our color palette minimal while still providing
	visual variation.

<p>There’s a fair amount of whimsy and a whole lot of adventure in the RV world. <strong>We decided that illustrations were the best way to carry that whimsy off of the streets and into our designs.</strong></p>
<p>I put on my illustrator hat and got to work doodling RVs and mountains. And thus our tiny orange RV was born! I’d be lying if I said there was no squealing once it was finished. It’s just so cute!</p>

<h6>“The drive is not always about the destination. The sights in between are just as interesting. There’s lots of help finding where to go, but not the best way to get there in an RV” </h6>

<p>
	This quote from one of our interviewees really stuck with me. Traveling in an
	RV, like life, (and UX!) is not necessarily about the destination.
	<strong>
		The journey is just as valuable, and the fastest route is not always the
		best option.
	</strong>
	There’s something to be said for choosing the road less traveled. You never
	know what adventures you’ll find along the way!
</p>

<h6>Waiting too long for feedback is wasteful</h6>
<p>
	<strong>It’s of utmost importance to get feedback early and often.</strong>
	Not just from users, but from developers and other team members. We could have
	saved so many headaches had we taken more time to learn about our dev team’s capabilities.
</p>

<h6>You are not your users</h6>
<p>
	Just because something makes sense to you and your peers, doesn’t mean it will
	make sense to your users! If we rely on our assumptions without validation
	from users, we might end up with a product that users are not going to love or
	worse, not use at all.
	<strong>
		Users will always have a different perspective on what is and what is not
		useful.
	</strong>
</p>

<h6>“Sometimes you have to yeet your babies.”</h6>
<p>
	A mentor once gave me this invaluable advice:
	<strong>
		like most things in life, the first solution is not always the best
		solution.
	</strong>
	Iteration is key, and there’s always room for improvement. This project
	provided ample opportunities for me to “yeet my babies.”
	<strong>
		I learned not to get too attached to any of my designs, to be flexible, and
		open to feedback in all forms.
	</strong>
